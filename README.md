# mdsvx blog

Based on [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) and [mdsvex](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/docs/)


## Creating a new post


Either create a new `.svx` file in `src/routes/blog`,
or create a new directory in that directory and then create an `index.svx` file in there as well.

## Detailed instructions

I've created a few blog posts that describe the thought process to writing on this blog.
I've deployed these on my github pages.
